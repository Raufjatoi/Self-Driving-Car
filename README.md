> [!WARNING]
> This project is still in the exploration phase as I am figuring it out. ðŸ˜Š

> [!NOTE]
> This is a collaborative project involving team members [Ahsan](https://github.com/MrAhsan777), [Umar](https://github.com/Umarkeerio), and [Rehman](#). We are currently deciding whether to focus on hardware or software development, so the direction of this repository is still under consideration.

**Features**  
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Utilizing reinforcement learning techniques to train the car.
- **Simulation**: Run simulations in the CARLA environment to test driving capabilities.
- **Custom Scenarios**: Create custom driving scenarios for varied training experiences.


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> carla is very large open source application where you teach the cars to learn in the enviro , so better read their docs before starting here: [Carla](https://carla.org/)
